This repo contains the code for our CS231N project submission where we generate a synthetic dataset and fine-tune a VLM on it, and then observe performance improvements on MathVista.

There are two parts of this repo that do not contain original code:
* The finetune_changes_copy/ directory: this contains files from the InternLM-XComposer repo (https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-XComposer/tree/main) that we slightly modify in order to meet our fine-tuning needs. These are mainly just changes to the finetuning configs (we add two sample configs that we use for LoRA and DoRA), and a minor change to the finetuning script to support DoRA (in addition to LoRA).
* The utils.py file - this contains some helper functions, some of which are taken from the InternLM repo mentioned above, and some which are taken from the MathVista repo: https://github.com/lupantech/MathVista.
